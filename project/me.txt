Hello there, I'm Pedro.
I've been working as a web developer for the past five years and would love to experience living and working in another country.
In fact that's a wish I've had since a was really young and it's always driven the choices I made in life.

I gradually discovered the web technologies and I'm particularly excited about the growing merges between Web platforms and mobile applications.
My goal is to create easily accessible web tools that will enhance the users experience.

Also, I love planning and refactoring.
Clean and elegant code, with great interface declaration, is coffee to me. Could work on it for days straight.

A short summary of my experience path from start to [there is no end] is 
Database, PHP, Wordpress, Basic Frontend, Javascript Framework, Progressive Web Apps..
